## About the project

Game: Dead By Daylight
Number of players: 2
Objective: The killer needs to kill the survivor, where the winner is the one who killed the survivor faster

### Project details

Players will need to ban and select common killers according to the BO3, BO5, etc. system, where there is a killer for each round.

For each killer, players need to ban one map in turn until there is one map left to play on.

For each killer, players need to choose n-number of killer skills in turn until the number of selected killer skills is equal to the required number of selected killer skills. If the required number of selected killer skills is equal to the number of killer skills, then they are selected automatically.

For each killer, players need to choose n-number of survivor skills in turn until the number of selected survivor skills is equal to the required number of selected survivor skills. If the required number of selected survivor skills is equal to the number of selected survivor skills, then they are selected automatically.

The killer and the survivor are at the shack or in the main building, where the killer needs to confirm that he is ready for the chase, and after confirmation, the survivor also needs to confirm that he is ready for the chase. After the killer and the survivor confirm, the timer starts. After the killer kills the survivor, the timer stops. After the timer stops, the players switch places from the killer to the survivor, from the survivor to the killer, where the process is repeated. And after all this, it is determined who caught the survivor faster, and thus wins the round.

When the players finish all the rounds (According to the BO3, BO5, etc. system), we determine who won more rounds, and thus find out the winner.

At the end, we make a calculation according to the ELO rating system, where the winner is awarded + points, and the loser - points.
